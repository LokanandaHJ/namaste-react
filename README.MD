Ep1
Create react app uses webpack BTS
we are using Parcel as bundler - its a library

Package.lock.json -> keeps exact version that is installed

Props -> its like arguments to the Functional comp

Swiggy ->Config driven UI

2 typs of export
a> default export -> import 'A' from '../../../../'
b> named export -> import {A} from '../../../

Shimmer UI
First UI before actual UI

UseEffect
Everytime component is rendered useEffect is called
Without any dependencies [] useEffect is called everytime component is rendered

<Link> -> do not reload the page -> single page application
 or <a> -> reload the page

2 typs of routing

- client side -> Single page application -> Just loads the component -> one page just components getting interchanged
- server side -> HTML is coming from server side -> make network call to server for info

## Dynamic routing
